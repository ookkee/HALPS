# PROJECT PLAN: HIRALAB ANDROID LOCAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (HALPS)

## Introduction
This local positioning system calculates a relative position for the user by using
a mobile Android device's accelerometers. 

## Planned features
* a step counter using the accelerometers
* a method for calculating the angle on the XY-plane
* plotting the walked route

### Extra features
* using Open Street Map as a base for plotting
* make the map scalable

## Objectives
Collect data from accelerometer sensors for various situations: 
* being still
* walking
* running
* rotating
* translation
* changing elevation
